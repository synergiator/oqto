### [oqto-5ey4] Migrate from oqto-browser to agent-browser (P0, epic)

### [oqto-m7br] Security: models.json written with 644 permissions - eavs API keys readable by all users (P0, bug)
In scripts/admin/eavs-provision.sh line 265, models.json is written with mode 644 (world-readable). This file contains the embedded eavs virtual API key. In multi-user deployments, any user on the system can read another user's API key by accessing their ~/.pi/agent/models.json.

Fix: Change mode from '644' to '600' in the write_file_as_user call. Also audit all other write_file_as_user calls that write sensitive content.

File: scripts/admin/eavs-provision.sh:265
...


### [oqto-29e1] Stability: hstry gRPC high-availability with local spool fallback (P0, epic)
hstry is currently a single point of failure. If the hstry gRPC service becomes unavailable, all message persistence fails with no graceful degradation. This is especially critical for long-running agent sessions where losing message history is unacceptable.

## Problem Statement

From AGENTS.md: "All chat history access goes through hstry's gRPC API - no raw SQLite access from oqto." This creates a hard dependency on hstry availability.
...


### [oqto-e067] Security: Implement runner mTLS authentication and attestation (P0, epic)
Runner registration currently uses a simple runner_id with no cryptographic verification. This allows potential runner impersonation attacks where a malicious process could register as a legitimate runner and intercept or manipulate agent sessions.

## Requirements

1. Implement mTLS between runner and backend
...


### [oqto-n7zc] setup.sh: fix full user provisioning pipeline (pi, eavs, models, runner) (P0, epic)
setup.sh must correctly provision everything for a new platform user on a fresh install:

1. Pi installation: install pi-coding-agent system-wide with a bun wrapper that works for all users (not hardcoded to installer's HOME)
2. Eavs config: always generate proper config under oqto user with [keys] enabled, master key, and env file
3. Per-user provisioning on login/creation:
...


### [oqto-14b1.3] Frontend: ServeView iframe panel with hot reload (P1, task)
New view in the session screen alongside chat, files, terminal, browser.

- New ViewKey: "serve" added to the type union
- WsEvent::ServeStart -> store instance metadata, auto-switch to serve view
- WsEvent::ServeReload -> increment iframe key (triggers full page reload)
...


### [oqto-14b1.2] Backend: serve API routes and port allocation (P1, task)
Add serve management routes to the oqto backend:

Routes:
- POST /serve/start -- allocate port, register instance, broadcast WsEvent::ServeStart
- POST /serve/reload -- broadcast WsEvent::ServeReload
...


### [oqto-14b1.1] oqto-serve CLI: static file server with swc TypeScript transpilation (P1, task)
Implement the oqto-serve Rust binary with start/stop/list subcommands.

start flow:
1. Contact oqto backend to allocate port (POST /serve/start)
2. Bind HTTP server on 127.0.0.1:{port}
...


### [oqto-14b1] oqto-serve: agent web application server (P1, epic)
Implement oqto-serve, a CLI + HTTP server that lets agents serve self-contained HTML/CSS/JS apps to the user within the oqto frontend.

Architecture:
- oqto-serve CLI (Rust binary): start/stop/list/scaffold commands
- Static file serving with swc TypeScript transpilation (no Node/Bun)
...


### [oqto-dbbw.1] Spec: finalize --app-* CSS token list and window.apphost bridge API (P1, task)
Write the formal spec document at docs/design/byteowlz-app-runtime.md.

Contents:
- Final list of --app-* CSS variables with semantic descriptions
- window.apphost unified interface:
...


### [oqto-dbbw] Byteowlz App Runtime: shared contract for portable agent-generated web apps (P1, epic)
Define and implement the shared contract that lets agent-generated HTML/CSS/JS apps run identically in oqto (iframe via oqto-serve) and omni (inline Tauri webview) without changes.

## Shared Contract

### 1. CSS Token Contract (--app-* variables)
...


### [oqto-mgbq] Test agent-browser with streaming to oqto frontend (P1, task)
Test agent-browser with streaming to oqto frontend

Streaming Quality Analysis:
============================

...


### [oqto-4016] Research agent-browser integration points and verify protocol compatibility (P1, task)

### [oqto-zkyq] Canonical history migration (server-side) (P1, feature)

### [oqto-q5yb] Credential proxy on oqto-runner: secret-aware API proxying via kyz (P1, feature)
## Summary

Add a credential proxy endpoint to oqto-runner. When an agent needs to make an authenticated API call, it hits the runner's `/v1/proxy` endpoint with a kyz secret reference. The runner resolves the credential from the user's kyz vault, injects it into the outbound HTTP request, and returns only the API response. The agent never sees plaintext credentials.

## Why runner, not eavs
...


### [oqto-pzya] Crash recovery: Pi stderr capture, session reconnect, auto-respawn with backoff (P1, epic)

### [oqto-q8cf] Implement graceful shutdown for oqto updates and restarts (P1, feature)
Currently, oqto lacks graceful shutdown for sessions during updates. When restarting oqto or oqto-runner, all agent sessions are terminated with SIGKILL, which abruptly interrupts active agent work.

**Problem:**
- Sessions receive SIGKILL (no SIGTERM, no wait period)
- Active LLM responses are interrupted mid-stream
...


### [oqto-cxxr] Security: Defense-in-depth sandboxing with seccomp-bpf fallback (P1, feature)
Current sandboxing relies solely on bwrap (bubblewrap). This is a single point of failure—if bwrap has vulnerabilities or is not available, agents run completely unsandboxed. Additionally, bwrap requires elevated privileges (setuid) which is a security risk itself.

## Current State

- Primary: bwrap with configurable profiles
...


### [oqto-fezg] Stability: Circuit breaker and backpressure for WebSocket connections (P1, feature)
The frontend uses a single multiplexed WebSocket for all communication. Without circuit breakers or backpressure, temporary backend slowdowns can cascade into frontend unresponsiveness or reconnection storms.

## Current Behavior

- No explicit backpressure on event stream
...


### [oqto-35fg] Scalability: PostgreSQL backend for hstry beyond SQLite limits (P1, epic)
hstry uses SQLite which has fundamental scaling limits. Current design supports tens to low-hundreds of users. Enterprise deployments require 1000+ concurrent users with high message throughput.

## SQLite Limitations

- Write contention: ~1-5K writes/sec max
...


### [oqto-8f14] Scalability: Protocol versioning for canonical protocol evolution (P1, feature)
The canonical protocol (docs/design/canonical-protocol.md) currently has no versioning mechanism. Adding new Part types, Event variants, or Command payloads will break older runners or frontends. This blocks safe protocol evolution.

## Requirements

1. Version Negotiation
...


### [oqto-q3qf] oqto should call usermgr to respawn dead runners before connecting (P1, bug)
In multi-user mode, runner_for_user() just connects to the socket without checking if the runner is alive. If the runner dies (e.g. pkill, OOM, user systemd crash), oqto returns 'connecting to runner at ...' errors forever. It should call usermgr setup-user-runner to respawn first if the socket is stale or missing.

### [oqto-y05n] Browser-side STT via Moonshine WASM — eliminate server-side eaRS for voice mode (P1, feature)

### [oqto-c6n3] Refactor: route all mux file operations through oqto-files instead of RunnerUserPlane (P1, task)

### [oqto-fr2f] Admin UI: manage eavs providers and sync models.json (P1, feature)
Add admin interface for managing LLM providers:

1. Admin settings page shows configured eavs providers with status (API key set/missing, test result)
2. Admins can add/remove/edit providers (type, API key, base_url)
3. Provider API keys are written to eavs env file, provider config to eavs config.toml
...


### [oqto-q4ae] setup.sh must guarantee hstry is running and accessible for every provisioned user (P1, bug)
Production shows 500 on /api/chat-history with 'Chat history service not configured for this user.' for wismut-vCmT. Root cause: get_runner_for_user() returns None in multi-user mode, which is a hard error. The setup process needs to:

1. Verify hstry binary is installed and accessible
2. Verify per-user hstry config exists (~/.config/hstry/config.toml)
3. Verify per-user systemd service is created, enabled, and started
...


### [oqto-mvdv] Streaming reliability: backpressure handling, reconnect resync, and delta coalescing (P1, epic)
Our WebSocket layer (ws-manager.ts) assumes a perfect connection. Pi-mobile (https://github.com/ayagmar/pi-mobile) demonstrates several transport reliability patterns we lack that cause real user-facing issues: silent message loss under backpressure, corrupted UI after reconnect, excessive re-renders during fast streaming, and no cross-device drift detection.

This epic addresses the foundational transport reliability gap between Octo and pi-mobile's approach. The core philosophy: assume the connection will break, and design every layer around recovery.

## Current Problems
...


### [octo-nqg8.9] Replace unsafe env::set_var in octo-runner and test code (P1, task)
Two categories of unsafe env::set_var/remove_var:

1. bin/octo-runner.rs line 3650 - set_var at startup for .env loading. Replace with a proper env file loading approach: either collect all vars into a HashMap and apply them before spawning threads, or use a crate like dotenvy which handles this safely.

2. auth/config.rs tests (4 blocks) and local/sandbox.rs tests (3 blocks) - set_var/remove_var in tests. Replace with the temp_env crate (temp_env::with_var/with_vars) which provides scoped env var overrides that are automatically cleaned up, or use serial_test with proper isolation.

### [octo-nqg8.8] Replace unsafe termios code in octoctl with rpassword crate (P1, task)
ctl/main.rs uses 4 unsafe blocks (lines 2274-2291) for terminal echo suppression during password input via raw libc::tcgetattr/tcsetattr. Replace entire read_password() function with the rpassword crate which provides a safe, cross-platform rpassword::read_password() function that handles all the terminal manipulation safely.

### [octo-nqg8.7] Replace unsafe libc calls with nix crate safe wrappers (P1, task)
Replace all unsafe libc calls with safe alternatives from the nix crate (already listed in workspace Cargo.toml):

1. api/handlers/projects.rs - libc::geteuid()/getegid() (4 blocks) -> nix::unistd::geteuid()/getegid()
2. local/sandbox.rs - libc::getpwnam + pointer deref (2 blocks) -> nix::unistd::User::from_name()
3. runner/client.rs - libc::getpwnam + pointer deref (2 blocks) -> nix::unistd::User::from_name()
...


### [octo-nqg8.6] Remove dead code in user_plane/, ws/, canon/, container/, api/, session/, templates/, onboarding/, workspace/, hstry/ (P1, task)

- local/sandbox.rs (9): SandboxConfig methods (minimal, strict, from_profile, from_profile_with_custom, load_from_workspace, merge_with_workspace, with_workspace_config, build_bwrap_args_for_user, is_bwrap_available)
- local/linux_users.rs (6): PROJECT_PREFIX const, LinuxUsersConfig methods (project_username, ensure_project_user, chown_directory_to_user, effective_username, ensure_effective_user)
...


### [octo-nqg8.4] Remove dead code in runner/pi_translator.rs and runner/client.rs (P1, task)
Remove dead code:
- runner/pi_translator.rs (8+): PiTranslator struct and all methods (new, set_pending_client_id, translate, on_agent_start, on_agent_end, etc), plus standalone functions (pi_response_to_canonical, pi_agent_message_to_canonical, pi_content_to_parts, pi_image_to_part, pi_stop_reason, extract_text_content)
- runner/client.rs (8+): write_stdin, subscribe_stdout, list_sessions, get_session, list_main_chat_sessions, search_memories, add_memory, delete_memory, pi_unsubscribe, pi_get_last_assistant_text, pi_set_steering_mode, pi_set_follow_up_mode, pi_export_html, pi_bash, pi_abort_bash, StdoutSubscription, StdoutSubscriptionEvent, PiSubscription and its methods

### [octo-nqg8.3] Remove dead code in history/ module (repository.rs, service.rs, models.rs) (P1, task)
Remove ~19 dead code items:
- history/repository.rs (14): hstry_db_path, HSTRY_POOL_CACHE static, open_hstry_pool, hstry_timestamp_ms, list_sessions_from_hstry, get_session_from_hstry, get_session_messages_from_hstry, list_sessions, list_sessions_from_dir, list_sessions_grouped, get_session, get_session_from_dir, update_session_title, update_session_title_in_dir
- history/service.rs (3): get_session_messages_async, get_session_messages_rendered_from_hstry, get_session_messages_rendered
- history/models.rs (2): SessionInfo struct, SessionTime struct
These are legacy history functions superseded by hstry gRPC.

### [octo-nqg8.2] Remove dead code in pi/ module (runtime.rs, types.rs, session_parser.rs, client.rs) (P1, task)
Remove ~31 dead code items across the pi module:
- pi/runtime.rs (15): PiSpawnConfig, PiProcess trait, PiRuntime trait, LocalPiRuntime, LocalPiProcess, RunnerPiRuntime, RunnerPiProcess, ContainerPiRuntime, ContainerPiProcess and all their methods
- pi/types.rs (13): PiCommand enum, ImageContent, ImageSource, PiResponse, PiEvent enum, AssistantMessageEvent, ToolResultMessage, ContentBlock, ToolCall, ToolResult, ExtensionUiRequest, PiMessage, PiMessage::parse
- pi/session_parser.rs (3): TITLE_PATTERN static, ParsedTitle struct and all methods
- pi/client.rs (1): PiClientConfig struct
...


### [octo-nqg8.1] Remove dead code in runner/pi_manager.rs (P1, task)
Remove ~28 dead code items: PiSessionManager, PiSession, PiManagerConfig, PiSessionConfig, PiSessionCommand, PiEventWrapper, PendingResponses, PendingClientId, HstryExternalId, ModelCacheEntry, JsonlMessageKey, JsonlEntry, JsonlSessionInfoEntry, JsonlMessageEntry, StatsDelta, and all associated functions (message_signature, build_jsonl_key, build_metadata_json, compute_stats_delta, read_jsonl_message_entries, read_jsonl_session_name, resolve_jsonl_message_indices, fetch_last_hstry_idx, resolve_jsonl_session_title). This is the largest concentration of dead code - the entire old Pi session management that was superseded by the runner architecture.

### [octo-nqg8] Eliminate all Rust warnings and unsafe code in backend (P1, epic)
Fix all ~398 compiler warnings in the backend workspace without bandaid fixes (#[allow], etc). This includes removing ~201 dead code items, replacing ~15 unsafe blocks with safe alternatives, fixing 164 ts-rs serde parse warnings, removing unused imports, and addressing unused variables. All changes must preserve existing functionality - dead code should only be removed if truly unused, not just stubbed.

### [octo-9cdt] Make hstry the sole history source while preserving streaming (P1, epic)

### [octo-wg67] Implement @@ cross-agent routing in runner (P1, task)

### [octo-1hbb] Define runner session state machine and command dispatch (P1, task)

### [octo-y5r3] Octo migration: replace all direct SQLite access with hstry gRPC client calls (P1, epic)

### [octo-xxe2] Per-workspace hstry/mmry stores + sync scoping (P1, task)
Ensure each workspace has isolated hstry/mmry stores; sync and cache are workspace-scoped with location_id/actor metadata. No cross-workspace leakage.

Note: hstry-core now has Sender/SenderType types in parts.rs (see hstry trx-7fh3, completed) for message attribution. This can be used for multi-user workspace scenarios.

### [octo-wdkj] Remote runner bootstrap over SSH (P1, task)
Implement SSH bootstrap: install deps, download runner binaries, configure sandbox, start service, register with hub. Provide fallback to bundle+push.

### [octo-59py] Workspace locations schema + routing (P1, task)
Add workspace_locations (workspace_id, runner_id, path, kind, repo_fingerprint, active flag) and route requests by selected location. Default to local if present; prompt on failure.

### [octo-pdb4] Shared workspaces with multi-location runners (P1, epic)
Support team shared workspaces with per-workspace hstry/mmry, local+remote locations, and explicit agent targeting. Includes runner bootstrap over SSH, workspace location routing, UI grouping/merge-split, and security model for remote execution + history sync.

### [octo-1ddx] Move global sandbox config to read-only path (P1, task)
Global sandbox config must be read-only (not user-writable). Implement loading from system path (e.g., /etc/octo/sandbox.toml) with user config for overrides or removal of user-writable global config. Ensure sandbox.toml itself is protected and update docs/install.

### [octo-t2bf] Multi-Runner & Workspace Sharing (P1, epic)
Epic for enabling users to connect to multiple runners across different machines (laptop, desktop, cloud) and share workspaces with other users.

## Goals

### Multi-Runner Support

- ensure linger + octo-runner user unit enabled
- verify runner socket reachable after provisioning
...


### [octo-xjs5.6] Security: runner socket authz + strict path guards (P1, task)
Harden the runner boundary:
- unix socket permissions via /run/octo/runner-sockets/<linux_username>/octo-runner.sock (group octo)
- runner validates every request against its own user roots
- deny dangerous env vars, validate binary allowlist
- ensure backend cannot ask runner to read outside workspace/main-chat dirs
...


### [octo-xjs5.5] Backend: route all user operations through runner (P1, task)
Refactor backend handlers/proxies so all user-plane operations are served via runner:
- sessions list/create/resume/stop
- terminal + opencode process lifecycle
- workspace file viewer
- memories (mmry target resolution)
...


### [octo-xjs5.4] Runner API: main chat storage ownership (P1, task)
Make main chat data physically per-user:
- move main chat DB + session files into linux user's home dir
- runner provides APIs for main chat list/create/load/save
- migrate existing shared main chat data into per-user location

...


### [octo-xjs5.3] Runner API: per-user mmry lifecycle (P1, task)
Move mmry lifecycle/port ownership fully into runner:
- allocate stable per-user mmry port (persisted in per-user db)
- spawn/stop/pin mmry process for that linux user
- health check + log capture
- expose mmry external_api URL for backend proxy
...


### [octo-xjs5.2] Runner API: per-user file operations (P1, task)
Define + implement runner-side filesystem API used by the backend:
- list tree, read file, write file, mkdir, stat
- path validation against per-user workspace roots (no traversal)
- optional read/write quotas

...


### [octo-xjs5.1] Runner API: user-plane session registry (P1, task)
Add runner RPC endpoints for per-user session state:

- persist session metadata in per-user store (DB or JSON) owned by the linux user
- include workspace path validation against runner-owned workspace roots
- return ports + status + errors
...


### [octo-thhx.2] Onboarding API endpoints (P1, task)
REST endpoints: GET/PUT /api/onboarding/state, POST /api/onboarding/unlock/{component}, POST /api/onboarding/godmode, POST /api/onboarding/complete

### [octo-thhx.1] Onboarding state model and database schema (P1, task)
Backend model for tracking onboarding progress, unlocked components, user level, and language preference. Store in user preferences table or dedicated onboarding_state table.

### [octo-thhx] Onboarding & Agent UI Control (P1, epic)
Progressive onboarding experience with wizard-driven UI, spotlight system, and i18n support. Onboarding uses step-by-step wizard forms, NOT agent-driven A2UI conversations.

### [octo-af5j.7.6] Release manifest generator (byt release) (P1, task)
byt release command that: 1) Reads component list from octo/release.toml, 2) Fetches current version from each repo (Cargo.toml, package.json, go.mod), 3) Generates versions.toml with all pinned versions, 4) Optionally tags all repos with octo-0.2.0 tag

### [octo-af5j.7.1] Version manifest file format (P1, task)
Define versions.toml or versions.json schema that lists all component versions for a release. Embedded in binary or fetched at runtime.

### [octo-af5j.7] Dependency version pinning and compatibility matrix (P1, feature)

### [octo-af5j] Release & Update System (P1, epic)
Comprehensive system for distributing Octo releases, managing updates in the field, and expanding runtime options including Proxmox LXC support.

### [workspace-jux6.1] Lazy load main app components (P1, task)
Convert synchronous imports in apps/index.ts to React.lazy() imports. Currently SessionsApp, AgentsApp, ProjectsApp, SettingsApp, AdminApp are all bundled together. This blocks initial render with unused code.

Location: frontend/apps/index.ts:1-56

Implementation:
...


### [oqto-14b1.6] Runner: app_message command and ServeMessage event routing (P2, task)
Add support in the runner for bidirectional app messaging.

Inbound (frontend -> agent):
- New mux command: {channel: "agent", cmd: "app_message", session_id, serve_id, data}
- Runner receives, formats as structured input for Pi (e.g. JSON on stdin or a special tool response)
...


### [oqto-14b1.5] ServeView: postMessage bridge for apphost.send/onMessage (P2, task)
Implement the bidirectional messaging channel between served apps and the agent session.

Outbound (app -> agent):
- iframe calls apphost.send(data)
- apphost shim does window.parent.postMessage({type: "apphost:send", data}, "*")
...


### [oqto-h8v2.2] Theme selection UI in settings (P2, task)
Add theme picker to the settings panel.

- Dropdown or toggle for built-in themes (oqto-light, oqto-dark)
- Preview swatch showing key colors
- Later: section for custom themes with add/edit/delete
...


### [oqto-h8v2.1] Extract current palettes into named theme objects (P2, task)
Refactor globals.css to load theme variables from a theme definition rather than hardcoding them.

- Create a Theme type/interface that holds all CSS variable values (background, foreground, card, primary, muted, border, destructive, etc.)
- Define oqto-light and oqto-dark as the two built-in themes using the current values from globals.css
- Apply theme by setting CSS variables on :root from the theme object
...


### [oqto-h8v2] Custom theming support for oqto (P2, epic)
Enable custom color themes in oqto. The current light and dark palettes become the default theme. Users can create custom themes that override the CSS variables.

Architecture:
- Themes defined as named sets of CSS variable values (same variables as current globals.css :root and .dark)
- Default themes: "oqto-light" (current :root) and "oqto-dark" (current .dark)
...


### [oqto-14b1.4] oqto-serve scaffold command with embedded templates (P2, task)
Implement the scaffold subcommand with embedded templates (include_dir! or equivalent).

Templates (all using --app-* tokens from byteowlz app runtime contract):
- blank: minimal index.html + style.css + empty main.ts
- dashboard: grid of stat cards, data table, status indicators
...


### [oqto-dbbw.3] Create apphost-shim.js bridge script (P2, task)
Tiny JS shim (~50 lines) that provides window.apphost in any context.

Behavior:
- If window.apphost already exists (set by host before app loads), does nothing
- Otherwise sets up postMessage listener for iframe contexts (oqto-serve):
...


### [oqto-dbbw.2] Create app-tokens.css with fallback defaults for all --app-* vars (P2, task)
Create the base stylesheet that provides fallback values for all 14 --app-* CSS variables. Two variants: :root (dark defaults using oqto dark palette) and .light class (oqto light palette).

Also includes:
- border-radius: 0 everywhere (shared aesthetic)
- Monospace font stack default
...


### [oqto-fp4w] Update dependencies.toml to track agent-browser version (P2, task)

### [oqto-pnz5] Test all existing oqto-browser commands work with agent-browser (P2, task)

### [oqto-acy9] Add agent-browser to oqto installation script and justfile (P2, task)

### [oqto-z582] Update AgentBrowserManager to use agent-browser binary (P2, task)

### [oqto-qvtw] Update oqto AgentBrowserConfig to support both oqto-browser and agent-browser (P2, task)

### [oqto-d2vk] mmry port collision: stale configs cause port conflicts for new users (P2, bug)

### [octo-p3n2.8] Auth middleware: support api_key query param on WebSocket paths (P2, task)
Extend is_websocket_auth_path to also accept ?api_key=oqak_xxx on /ws/mux, /voice/stt, /voice/tts. Resolve API key to user_id and create CurrentUser same as JWT path. Update auth priority: Bearer > X-Api-Key > cookie > ?token > ?api_key > X-Dev-User.

### [octo-p3n2.7] oqto web UI: Connect to omni button with omni:// deep-link generation (P2, task)
In oqto Settings -> API Keys section, add a Connect to omni button. When clicked: auto-create an API key named omni-vanilla, generate omni://link/oqto-pulse?url=<server>&key=<api_key> URL, show it as clickable link and QR code. Clicking opens omni-vanilla which auto-configures the plugin.

### [oqto-3k0c] mmry port allocation doesn't prevent orphan config collisions (P2, bug)
When users are deleted from the frontend but not from the OS, their mmry config files retain the port allocation. When the DB record is deleted, that port is freed in the DB but the orphaned mmry-service process still holds it. New users can then be allocated the same port via ensure_mmry_port (which only checks the DB), causing 'Address already in use' crash-loops.

Root cause: delete_user only removed from DB, not from OS. Fixed by adding full Linux cleanup to delete-user.

Additional concern: if usermgr provisioning writes the mmry config before the DB port is persisted, and provisioning fails midway, the config file retains a port that was never committed to the DB.
...


### [oqto-1fck] Session duplication in frontend sidebar - platform_id not set in hstry (P2, bug)
Sessions created from the oqto frontend appear duplicated in the sidebar. Root cause: when a Pi session is created via the runner, the hstry conversation entry gets external_id (Pi native ID) but platform_id (oqto session ID) is NULL. The merge_duplicate_sessions() dedup logic in chat.rs can't match the hstry entry with the runner's live session because they have different IDs. Example: oqto session oqto-2a079205 spawned Pi session 584ac6ee which hstry stores with readable_id=used-fort-save, but no platform_id linking back to the oqto ID.

### [oqto-5ym1] Pi does not recover from hung LLM streams (no stream timeout) (P2, bug)
When an upstream LLM provider (e.g. Kimi-K2.5) drops a streaming connection mid-response without sending [DONE] or an error, Pi hangs indefinitely in its event loop. The TCP connection closes but Pi never detects the stream ended. Observed on octo-azure where Kimi dropped reasoning_content mid-token. Pi should implement a stream inactivity timeout (e.g. 120s with no chunks) and surface it as an error so the user can retry.

### [oqto-pdxp] User systemd session not resilient to runner kills in multi-user mode (P2, bug)
When runners are killed via pkill from an SSH session, the SSH session exit can also terminate user@UID.service, preventing the runner's systemd Restart=always from working. The runner stays dead with a stale socket. Linger is enabled but user@UID has no way to auto-start without a login or explicit systemctl start. Consider: 1) usermgr health-checking runner sockets periodically, 2) oqto calling ensure_runner before connecting.

### [oqto-mvdv.4] Session freshness fingerprinting for cross-device drift detection (P2, task)
Add session freshness polling to detect when the session file has been modified outside Octo's knowledge (e.g., by another browser tab or direct Pi CLI usage). Poll a fingerprint (mtime + size + entry count + tail hash) every ~4 seconds and warn the user when stale state is detected.

## Reference
Pi-mobile polls bridge_get_session_freshness every 4s with a 90s grace window for local mutations. On mismatch, shows 'Sync now' warning.

### [octo-3d6q] Slash command popup driven by get_commands (P2, task)

### [octo-vrzt] Remove MainChatPiService legacy code (P2, task)
MainChatPiService in src/main_chat/pi_service.rs is legacy. Everything now goes through the runner path. Has deep tendrils: used by ws_multiplexed.rs (get_messages), api/handlers/chat.rs, api/main_chat_pi.rs (REST handlers), api/routes.rs, api/state.rs, api/handlers/agent_ask.rs, api/handlers/agent_rpc.rs, pi_workspace.rs. Need to migrate all callers to use runner client.

### [octo-mkvc] Remove legacy canon/ module (from_pi, from_hstry, from_opencode) (P2, task)
The old canon/ module (src/canon/{mod,types,from_pi,from_hstry,from_opencode}.rs) is only used by hstry/convert.rs which imports pi_message_to_canon, CanonMessage, ModelInfo.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend Host Support
...


### [octo-zjs8.4] Optimize Rust compilation times (P2, task)
Add .cargo/config.toml with linker optimizations, split-debuginfo, incremental builds, and codegen-units settings

### [octo-7xx0] Note: octo-ssh-proxy socket path must be mounted or moved for sandbox access (P2, task)

### [octo-8erz] Prevent template copy from following symlinks (P2, bug)
copy_template_dir uses fs::copy on DirEntry paths without checking for symlinks; on most platforms this follows symlinks and can copy arbitrary files outside the template repo into the new project. This is a security risk if template repos are user-supplied. Use symlink_metadata to detect symlinks and either skip, copy as symlink, or enforce that resolved targets stay within the template repo. Affected: backend/crates/octo/src/api/handlers.rs::copy_template_dir.

### [octo-015j] Move blocking filesystem work out of async request handlers (P2, task)
Several async handlers call std::fs synchronously (read_dir/read_to_string/copy), which can block the Tokio runtime under load. Convert to tokio::fs or wrap in spawn_blocking. Examples: backend/crates/octo/src/api/main_chat_pi.rs::get_prompt_commands (read_dir/read_to_string), backend/crates/octo/src/api/handlers.rs::list_workspace_dirs (read_dir), list_project_templates (read_dir), find_project_logo (read_dir), copy_template_dir (read_dir/fs::copy).

### [octo-smwr] Add drag an drop capabilities to the file tree, both for dragging in external files and for moving files between dirs  (P2, feature)

### [octo-s4ez] Define context model and context sources (local + remote) (P2, task)
## Goal
Define what "context" means for agent interactions in Octo, and how it is represented, versioned, and sourced, so features like global agent invoke (`octo-skks`) and agent-driven UI control (`octo-wzvn`) can reliably inject context now and later.

## Context Model (Proposed)
A versioned envelope composed of multiple context "sources".
...


### [octo-skks] Global main agent invoke with context injection (P2, feature)
## Problem\nUsers want to invoke the Main Agent from any page in the web app, and have the agent automatically receive UI/runtime context (current page/route, active app/view, selected agent/persona if applicable, selected workspace directory/project, current session IDs).\n\n## Proposed Feature\nAdd a globally-available Main Agent entrypoint (e.g., hotkey + floating button + command palette action) that opens the Main Chat/agent panel. When the user sends a message, inject a structured context block into the message/system prompt containing:\n- Current route/pathname\n- Active app/view (e.g. sessions/settings/admin)\n- Active agent/persona (if any)\n- Current workspace directory / project key\n- Current workspace session ID + current chat session ID (if available)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Main Agent can be opened from any page without navigation side effects.\n- Sent messages include the context injection reliably and deterministically.\n- Context injection is visible in logs/devtools (or can be toggled) for debugging.\n- Works when OpenCode is not running (falls back to disk/history context).\n- No regression to existing Main Chat / Sessions flows.\n\n## Notes\nImplementation likely touches: app shell routing, global UI overlay, and the message send pipeline (control-plane / opencode proxy headers).

### [octo-2r4f] Add slug field to session model and API responses (P2, task)

### [octo-6pkd] Left sidebar: '+' next to SESSIONS should create session in current project; add separate 'new directory/project' button (P2, feature)
UX change request:
- The "+" button next to "SESSIONS" in the left sidebar should open/create a new session/chat within the project the user is currently in.

## Design

### Core Concept
...


### [oqto-14b1.7] Serve proxy: apphost.fetch, readFile, writeFile capabilities (P3, task)
Implement optional capabilities on the apphost bridge in oqto.

apphost.fetch(url, opts):
- App posts fetch request via postMessage to ServeView
- ServeView proxies through backend (bypasses iframe CORS restrictions)
...


### [oqto-h8v2.4] Dynamic --app-* injection for oqto-serve iframes (P3, task)
When custom theming is active, oqto-serve iframes need to receive the live theme.

- ServeView sends postMessage with full --app-* variable mapping on:
  - Initial iframe load
  - Theme change events
...


### [oqto-h8v2.3] Custom theme definition format and loading (P3, task)
Allow users to define custom themes.

- Theme format: TOML or JSON file with all CSS variable overrides
- Theme directory: ~/.config/oqto/themes/ or managed via API
- Validation against the known variable set
...


### [oqto-dbbw.4] Create app-utils.css shared utility classes (P3, task)
Optional shared utility CSS that apps can use for common patterns. Uses only --app-* variables.

Classes:
- Layout: .panel, .box, .box-header, .box-title, .box-subtitle

...


### [oqto-amqb] Document streaming quality decision and defaults in AGENTS.md (P3, task)

### [oqto-rg67] Update .pi/skills/oqto-browser SKILL.md to reference agent-browser (P3, task)

### [oqto-c2r7] Update AGENTS.md and docs to reference agent-browser instead of oqto-browser (P3, task)

### [oqto-gwpa] Remove oqto-browser and oqto-browserd crates from codebase (P3, task)

### [oqto-ejm7] Frontend model picker should preselect the default model from .pi/settings.json (P3, feature)
When a workspace has a default provider/model set in .pi/agent/settings.json (defaultProvider + defaultModel), the model picker dropdown in the frontend should preselect that model instead of whatever was last used.

### [oqto-mgp5] Per-user eaRS instances for voice mode (parakeet engine) (P3, feature)

### [oqto-v9g0] Files panel shows stale file tree when switching between sessions in same workspace (P3, bug)

### [oqto-mvdv.5] WebSocket performance budget tracking and diagnostics (P3, task)
Add performance budget tracking for key streaming metrics:
- TTFT (prompt send to first text_delta): target 1200ms
- Reconnect-to-resync latency: target 2000ms
- Messages-per-second throughput during streaming
- Inbound queue depth high-water mark per session
...


### [octo-34f0] Migrate generate_pi_models_json to eavs API endpoint (P3, chore)
The octo backend has a duplicate of the Pi models.json generation logic in backend/crates/octo/src/eavs/mod.rs. Now that eavs has 'eavs models export pi' (and the export module), the octo backend should call an eavs API endpoint (e.g. GET /providers/export/pi) instead of duplicating the format logic. This would be a new API endpoint in eavs that returns the same JSON as the CLI command.

### [octo-qqg2] Support octo.install.toml for non-interactive setup with provider API keys (P3, feature)
Add support for reading an octo.install.toml file that pre-configures LLM providers and API keys for non-interactive setup. The file would be read at the start of setup.sh and converted into environment variables. This enables fully automated deployments without manual key entry. Format:
```toml
[providers]
anthropic = "sk-ant-..."
openai = "sk-..."
...


### [octo-wfs3] Expand fuzz testing to WebSocket commands, runner protocol, and Pi event parsing (P3, task)

### [octo-mxd8.4] macOS fallback: socket broker for guarded paths (P3, feature)
Implement a non-FUSE fallback for macOS that provides similar functionality to octo-guard using a socket-based broker.

## Overview
Since FUSE on macOS is problematic (kext deprecation, SIP issues), implement a simpler socket+copy approach.

...


### [octo-xncy.7] Android: UI exploration mode (DroidBot-style UTG crawler) (P3, task)
Build UI exploration/crawling mode for unknown apps.

## Approach
DroidBot-style UI Transition Graph (UTG) crawler:
1. Systematically explore app screens
...


### [octo-xncy.6] Android: MCP tools for agent control (snapshot, tap, type, scroll) (P3, task)

### [octo-xncy.5] Android: Frontend AndroidView component with touch forwarding (P3, task)

### [octo-xncy.4] Android: Screencast streaming to frontend (reuse BrowserView pattern) (P3, task)

### [octo-xncy] Android Emulator: Agent-controlled Android environment (P3, epic)
-

### [octo-mbeh] Deduplicate and centralize path sanitization logic (P3, task)
There are multiple path sanitization/validation implementations with overlapping intent (e.g., sanitize_relative_path in API handlers vs resolve_path/resolve_and_verify_path in the file server). This risks divergence and inconsistent security rules. Consider centralizing into a shared utility with shared tests. Affected: backend/crates/octo/src/api/handlers.rs::sanitize_relative_path, backend/crates/octo-files/src/handlers.rs::resolve_path/resolve_and_verify_path.

### [octo-a256] Consolidate CopyButton implementations and handle clipboard failures consistently (P3, task)
CopyButton logic is duplicated across multiple components with inconsistent error handling and timer cleanup (e.g., missing try/catch and no timeout cleanup on unmount). Consider a shared CopyButton component/hook with fallback copy logic and timeout cleanup. Affected: frontend/components/ui/markdown-renderer.tsx, frontend/components/ui/code-viewer.tsx, frontend/components/ui/typst-viewer.tsx, frontend/apps/admin/InviteCodesPanel.tsx, frontend/features/sessions/SessionScreen.tsx, frontend/features/main-chat/components/MainChatPiView.tsx.

### [octo-3trr] Add browser extension mode (Option A) - fork Playwriter (P3, feature)
Browser extension mode for controlling user's existing browser.

## Reference Implementation
- ../external-repos/playwriter - Fork this for Octo extension
- ../external-repos/clawdbot/src/browser/extension-relay.ts - CDP relay pattern
...


### [octo-thhx.18] Multi-lingual user support (P3, task)
Support users who speak multiple languages. Store languages array in USER.md. Agent can switch language based on context or explicit request. UI for managing language preferences.

### [octo-thhx.17] Technical user detection for terminal unlock (P3, task)
Subtle detection: profile questions about work, A2UI choice between visual vs command options, detection of shell-like input in chat. Unlocks terminal for technical users.

### [octo-k8z1.12] Documentation: Browser feature usage guide (P3, chore)

### [octo-k8z1.11] Container mode: Browser container per session (Docker/Podman) (P3, task)

### [octo-k8z1.10] Human-in-the-loop: Credential access approval modal (P3, task)

### [octo-k8z1.9] Credential vault: UI for storing encrypted credentials (P3, task)

### [octo-af5j.4.7.6] First-run wizard for Proxmox+Octo (P3, task)
Interactive or config-file based wizard: set admin password, configure EAVS API keys, set resource limits, create first user/agent.

### [octo-af5j.4.6] GPU passthrough for LXC (P3, task)
Pass NVIDIA GPU to LXC containers for local LLM inference. Share GPU across multiple containers.

### [octo-af5j.4.5] Proxmox cluster support (P3, task)
Distribute agent containers across cluster nodes. Handle migration. Resource balancing.

### [octo-af5j.4.4] LXC snapshot support (P3, task)
Create snapshots before risky operations. Rollback on failure. Scheduled snapshots for long-running agents.

### [octo-af5j.3.4] Update channels (stable/beta/nightly) (P3, task)
Support multiple release channels. Config option to set preferred channel. Beta gets release candidates, nightly gets every commit.

### [octo-vne5] Move simple tree file walk off the async runtime (P3, task)
fileserver/src/handlers.rs: get_simple_file_list uses WalkDir synchronously on the async thread. On large directories this can block the runtime and slow all requests. Run this in spawn_blocking or switch to an async walker.

### [octo-wmrf.7] A2UI Custom Components Catalog (P3, task)
Define Octo-specific A2UI component catalog extending standard catalog. Custom components: CodeBlock (syntax highlighted), DiffView, FileTree, ProgressBar, Terminal, MarkdownView. Register with renderer, document for agent use.

### [octo-a9ds] Main Chat: Agent coordination via mailz (P3, task)
Enable agent coordination for Main Chat:

1. mailz integration (messaging only):
   - Check inbox on session start
   - Send messages to other agents (e.g., govnr)
...


### [octo-a9mc] Main Chat: skdlr heartbeat integration (P3, task)
Integrate skdlr for periodic heartbeats in Main Chat:

1. skdlr schedule configuration:
   - Heartbeat schedule (e.g., every 4 hours)
   - Command: octo main-chat heartbeat
...


### [workspace-ufvs] Integrate qmd for document search (P3, task)
Add qmd (tobi/qmd) as optional document search backend. qmd excels at hybrid search (BM25 + Vector + Query Expansion + Re-ranking) for existing knowledge bases, meeting notes, docs. Complementary to mmry which handles agent memories. Consider: MCP server integration, collection management, hybrid with mmry for different use cases.

### [workspace-jux6.6] Make i18n loading async (P3, task)
initI18n() is called synchronously in main.tsx:8, blocking React render until translations load.

Location: frontend/src/main.tsx:8

Implementation:
...


### [workspace-5pmk.10] Add platform-specific native features (P3, task)
Desktop: window management, system tray, keyboard shortcuts. Mobile: haptic feedback, safe area insets, native share. Use Tauri plugins and conditional compilation.

### [octo-xncy.9] Android: Vision fallback with OmniParser/grounding model (P4, task)

### [octo-gpj7] Avoid unwrap on WS event serialization (P4, chore)
backend/src/ws/handler.rs and backend/src/ws/types.rs use serde_json::to_string(...).unwrap(). A serialization failure would panic the server. Use map_err/Result and return an error response instead, even if failure is unlikely.

### [octo-92yw] Deduplicate mmry proxy session checks (P4, chore)
backend/src/api/proxy.rs: proxy_mmry_* handlers repeat the same session lookup + active check + target/store resolution. Factor into a helper to reduce duplication and keep behavior consistent when rules change.

### [octo-h975] Main Chat: Message visibility filtering (hide tools by default) (P4, task)
Filter message visibility in Main Chat to show cleaner output:

Current behavior: All messages (including tool calls) visible in chat
Desired behavior: Tool calls hidden by default, toggle to show

...
